Impostor syndrome, also called the <u>impostor phenomenon</u>, is a psychological problem where the person who suffers from it believes that all their achievements, whether personal, work-related, or academic, are pure coincidence, and not because they deserve them.

It doesn't matter if you got a good grade on an exam, or if your boss congratulates you because you've completed a task in an amazingly good way, the person suffering from this syndrome will always say it was **luck**, **coincidence**, **the planets aligned**... Each one can call it whatever they want, but in short, the person suffering from this syndrome thinks they are never or will never be up to the situation or what is asked at any given moment.

#### Why might this happen to me?

Impostor syndrome usually occurs due to:

- **Low Self-Esteem.**
- Lack of security.
- Loss of self-confidence.
- Family problems in childhood.

As you can notice, practically those 4 points are the same thing, but it's not a mistake. The cause of impostor syndrome is having **very low self-esteem and little self-love**.

People who are so critical and perfectionist with themselves that their work is never enough or deserving of success also tend to suffer from this syndrome.

#### What do you feel when you have Impostor Syndrome?

When having impostor syndrome or the impostor phenomenon, the person who suffers from it feels:

- Constant fear of being discovered as a fraud.
- Demotivation due to lack of confidence.
- Lack of Confidence.
- Constant dissatisfaction.
- Believing they don't deserve the achievements or successes they obtain because they received help.

#### How to gradually get rid of these thoughts?

In the end, since this syndrome is a psychological problem, it's best to consult with a professional who knows how to handle your specific and particular situation, because humans are as different as colors.

One of my personal pieces of advice is that you start saying **THANK YOU** every time you're congratulated for something and even though it's hard at first, you have to start believing in your worth. Yes, just like that. It's easy to say, I know. But in the current society we live in, it's such a competitive world that really no one is going to give you anything for free, which means if you've achieved something, it's thanks to you and your effort.

If it's in the work environment, think that if they congratulate you, it's because for people external to you, you've done a great job, and...

- What does it matter if a colleague helped you?
- What does it matter if you found the solution on Google or StackOverflow?
- What does it matter if you woke up one day inspired and it came out without really knowing why?

My dear programmer, my dear programmer, we all need help, we all search for things on the internet, and we all wake up some days with such a bad day that we can't even say good morning properly.
