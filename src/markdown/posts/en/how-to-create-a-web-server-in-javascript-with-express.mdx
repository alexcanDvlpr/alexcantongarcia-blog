Since JavaScript (JS) was created, it has been called the "Language of the Web", and together with some libraries like JQuery, it was considered a front-end language. But in recent years, with the appearance of **Node.js**, we can program with JS on the backend.

If this is your first time reading about **Node.js**, you might be wondering... What is Node.js? You might think it's a new language based on JavaScript like **TypeScript**, but no, it's a JS runtime environment, based on Google's V8 engine, and was created by [Ryan Dahl](https://www.ecured.cu/Ryan_Lienhart_Dahl).

In this blog, we will see Node from the web development point of view, but it is also used for **Web Development**, **IoT**, **Bots**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and much more.

### How to create a web server?

To create a web server, in this article I will use the **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)** library, a backend-oriented library that is very minimalist but also powerful.

The first step is to create our Node project, create our directory **first-project** and run:

```shell
# Go to the directory
$ cd first-project/
# Create node project
$ npm init
```
The console will show us the first version of our **package.json** from which we can work.
```shell
Press ^C at any time to quit.                                            
package name: (first-project)                                         
version: (1.0.0)                                                        
description:                                                            
entry point: (index.js)                                                 
test command:                                                           
git repository:

About to write to ~/first-project/package.json:
                                                                        
{                                                                       
  "name": "first-project",                                            
  "version": "1.0.0",                                               
  "description": "",                                                 
  "main": "index.js",                                               
  "scripts": {                                                        
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"        
  },                                                                    
  "author": "Alex Canton",                                          
  "license": "ISC"                                                  
}                                                                       
                                                                        
                                                                        
Is this OK? (yes)
```

Once our project is created, we need to install our Express dependency, we can do it like this:

```shell
$ npm install express -S -E
```

The `-S` flag is to add it to the **dependencies** section in the `package.json` and `-E` to install the exact version. If we check the **package.json**, it would look like this:

```shell
$ cat package.json
{
  "name": "first-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "Alex CantÃ³n",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "4.17.1"
  }
}
```

Now that we have Express installed, we can start developing our server. Open your default entry file, **index.js**, and write:

```js
// Imports
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
// Port
const PORT = 3000
// Middlewares
app.use(express.json())
// Start Server
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running. http://localhost:${PORT}`)
})
```

In the following points, I will explain the different steps I followed in the previous code.

#### 1. Imports

The first thing we need to do for our server to work is import the libraries. In this case, since the only one installed is **express**, we import it and store the library in the variable, the next step is to create a web application with the **express()** function.

This application will be the one we start to have our server running.

#### 2. Port

This step is optional for this example, but I separated the port because in a medium/large project, the port may be parameterized depending on the environment. So it can be good practice to have it as a variable before applying it to the **.listen()** function.

#### 3. Middlewares

A Middleware, in general terms, is a piece of code that runs before the main request. For example, you can use a middleware for authentication, that is, create an <u>authMiddleware</u> and have it run before each server request to ensure the server is only accessible to already registered users.

This particular Middleware transforms both the request (**Request**) and the response (**Response**) into a <u>**JSON**</u> format, to maintain a communication standard with clients.

#### 4. Start Server

In this code block, we call **app.listen(...)**, which receives as a parameter the port on which our application will be deployed and the second parameter is a callback function that will run if the application starts correctly.

This execution will start our <u>backend server in Node.js</u>.

#### Execution

Now that we have the **index.js** file complete, we need to check that it works, for that we go to our command console and run:

```shell
$ node index.js
```

If everything works correctly, it should show the following message in the console:

```shell
Server is running. http://localhost:3000
```

But with this, we simply start a server on port 3000, but we can't access it. If we go to a browser at **http://localhost:3000** it will show the message `Cannot Get /`, this means it can't access the root, but the good news is the server is working.

With that explained, let's create an access route (or **endpoint**) to access the root.

#### Controller

In our <u>**index.js**</u>, before the **Start Server** step, add the following code block:

```js
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    return res.status(200).send({ message: 'Response message' })
})
```

With this code, our server will have an entry point at the root, using [the HTTP GET method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods), which will return a response with status 200 ([Server response codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)) and a JSON body with the following format:

```json
{
    "message": "Response message"
}
```
#### Conclusion

In this article, we have seen how we can create a web server with **JavaScript** and its best-known, minimalist, and powerful backend framework, **Express.js**. With just a few lines, we have been able to deploy a service on port 3000 that has an entry point at the root of the project, which would be our **http://localhost:3000/**.
