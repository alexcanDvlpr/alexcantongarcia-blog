In this article, we are going to see <u>what you need to start a Web Development project</u> or how to enter this world that at first can seem overwhelming.

What usually happens is that when searching for information about the world of Software or Web development, we find a huge list of Programming Languages to get things done. And that's one of our realities, there are countless languages. But wait, I have good news! You don't have to learn them all.

### Introduction to Web Development

Since programming was invented until today, many languages have been created, some to cover certain needs, others to replace worse ones... But in this post, we are going to focus only on the most basic and essential for web development.

These developments can be divided into two big groups, **Frontend** and **Backend**.

#### The Frontend

The Frontend can be described as what you see, that is, when you access a website in your browser (like this blog, for example) and see what loads, that's what the end user sees. It's often called "the client".

#### The Backend

The Backend is what no one sees, but makes a web application work, it's the part of development that receives requests from the client, processes or manages them, and returns the value to the client so it can be "rendered" on the web.

### How to start in development?

To start web development, **in my opinion** it's essential to learn the three base languages of the web (Frontend), which are **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript (JS)**

Technically, **HTML** and **CSS** are not programming languages, but markup languages, but without them the web couldn't exist, **HTML** is the language of the structure of our web and **CSS** is the language that gives style to the **HTML** tags, that is, colors, widths, heights, animations, etc... and **Javascript or JS** brings interactivity to the web, such as sending forms, getting data from an external resource, etc...

I base my opinion on the website [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/) where you can find different paths to become a backend developer, frontend (React or Angular), learn **Python** or **Java**. If we go to the **[Frontend Roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/frontend)** section, we can see that the first thing recommended is to have knowledge of the Internet (HTTP Protocol, search engines...) and then **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JS** in that order.

And personally, to start with those three languages, a collection of two books helped me a lot <AffiliateLink title="Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set" link="https://amzn.to/3sHmlHC" /> where they explain HTML, CSS, and JS in a very simple and structured way.

![Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnnfr3jhi/image/upload/v1639691907/Blog/Posts/empezar-desarrollo-web/41X2i47NXUL._SX435_BO1_204_203_200__asmrdv.webp)

Here is the Amazon link for those interested: <AffiliateLink title="https://amzn.to/3sHmlHC" link="https://amzn.to/3sHmlHC" />

All this, as I mentioned before, is for the **frontend**, but we still have the **backend** part, the logic and calculations, but this can be VERY extensive.

### Programming Languages

For the Backend, we can use all kinds of languages, if we use the same resource as before, we can see in [the backend roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) that in the **"Learn a Language"** section we have languages like **Java**, **JavaScript**, **C#**, **Python**, or **PHP**.

Of course, during your developer career you might have to switch languages, but normally you should be guided by:

- The supply/demand of the market in your country or region.
- Your preferences in programming, there are languages that have nothing to do with each other.
- The type of company you are in (consultancy or startup).

For example, here in Madrid (Spain), where I am and in the environment I move in, the big demand is for **Java** programmers, with its framework called **Spring Boot**; and **JavaScript (JS) or TypeScript (TS)** which on the server side is usually the **Node.js** development environment.

Anyway, here is the link to [the StackOverflow statistics of the most popular languages of 2021](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies).

### Web Development with JavaScript (JS)

In this blog, we will talk about web development with JS, both in the backend (Node.js) and in the frontend, and we will be introducing **TypeScript** (TS), which in colloquial language "is JavaScript on steroids". If among the readers there is someone impatient who can't wait for the next article on web development with JavaScript, you have [my affiliate page](https://www.alexcantongarcia.es/afiliados) where I recommend the book series **You Don't Know JS**.

![You Don't Know JS Collection](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnnfr3jhi/image/upload/v1640555098/Blog/Posts/empezar-desarrollo-web/you-don-t-know-js-6-volumes-set-original-imaextdbysx8sj9m_rq0t5u.webp)

This collection consists of 6 books, highly recommended, which I have read myself and have helped me continue my development with criteria and good practices.

### Conclusion

The world of development at first may seem like an endless ocean, full of doubts and things to learn, and the reality is that it is!

You just have to stop and think about what you would like to achieve, and start, as a phrase by Antonio Machado says, **The path is made by walking**, that is, don't just read a couple of posts or finish a tutorial and think you know everything about it, because you have a long way to go, and the things you know will probably generate more doubts for you, because it's a job of self-improvement, what you don't know how to do today, tomorrow you'll do "with your eyes closed".

I encourage you to follow this path, because it's a job different from others, in work environment and colleagues, and from my point of view it's very interesting and **it's really cool to type things and have the computer do what you want**. Go for it! Rome wasn't built in a day.
