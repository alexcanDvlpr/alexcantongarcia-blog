Nowadays, when we talk about a web development project, whether professional or a university project, we want that project not to get lost or deleted, and if someone messes up or there's a bug, to know when it happened and what it affects so we can fix it quickly, or simply to easily extract a `.zip` to deliver the whole project, and countless other things we can think of, right?

In short, it would be amazing if there was a decentralized code storage and management tool where 1 to X people could participate.

This type of tool I'm talking about is a **Version Control System** and today, and the reason you're reading this article, is because you want to learn how to use [GIT](https://git-scm.com/)

## What is Git?

As I mentioned earlier, **Git** is today the **most well-known and used version control system** in the world, created by **[Linus Torvalds](https://www.ecured.cu/Linus_Torvalds)**, developer of the Linux Kernel. Its main feature is that it is **distributed**, which means multiple people can work in teams on the same project.

In this post, we will see the different ways to install it depending on the Operating System (OS) you use.

## How do we install it?

For installation on both **Windows** and **Mac OS**, we can go to the [Official Git Page](https://git-scm.com/) and download the executable directly from their homepage:

![Git main page with the direct download link.](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnnfr3jhi/image/upload/v1639841263/Blog/Posts/DescargarGit/descargithome_gt34aw.webp)

However, here are the installation steps for the two systems I will cover in this post, **Windows** and **Mac OS**.

### Windows
The first step to install Git on our Windows system is to go to the [Git download page for Windows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and follow the steps indicated. Basically, you have to download the Git `.exe` and run it.
They give us two options, the **Git for Windows Setup** (full installation on your computer) and the **Git for Windows Portable ("thumbdrive edition")** (portable option).

My recommendation is the full installation on your computer.

![Git Download Page. We will select the Git for Windows Setup 64-bit option (depends on your computer)](https://res.cloudinary.com/dnnfr3jhi/image/upload/v1639829784/Blog/Posts/DescargarGit/git_download_ndkrnj.webp)

The typical installation screen will appear, click **Next -> Next -> Next** and finish the installation.

Once you click finish, the installation on Windows will be complete.

### Mac OS
For Mac OS systems, we have two installation options for the Git version control system.

You can install it via the Git website, as in the previous case with Windows, or with Homebrew.

#### Â· Git Website
In this case, go to the Git website, to the [installation section for Mac OS](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) and follow the steps indicated by Git. One of them is to use Homebrew.

#### Â· Homebrew
To download GIT with **Homebrew** you must have Homebrew installed.

Homebrew is a **Package Manager** for Mac, from which you can install countless programs and features, such as git. To install Homebrew, run the following command in your terminal:
```shell
$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Once the command is executed, enter your administrator password, wait a few minutes for the installer to do its magic, and once the console finishes, run:

```shell
$ brew -v
```

If it shows the version, it means you have Homebrew installed!

Now that we have it installed, it's time to install GIT, with the same console we had open. Run the following:

```shell
$ brew install git
```

And just like when we installed Homebrew, when the console finishes, we will have GIT installed on our Mac OS system.

### Conclusion

Once installed, we can now manage our web, mobile, or any type of software projects in an organized, clear, and distributed way.

No matter the OS you have or the installation method you chose, you can check that the installation was successful by running the following command in the terminal.

```shell
# Git command to see the current version.
$ git --version
```
With this command, you will see the current version of Git on your system, which of course means you have it installed.
