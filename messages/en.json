		"text1": "Hey there! I'm Alex Cant√≥n, born in Madrid in November '97 ‚Äî that time of year when people start buying nougat for no logical reason. I'm a fullstack developer and, although I officially studied Multiplatform Application Development at Francisco de Vitoria University, the truth is my real training began the day I wrestled with my first bug... and lost.",
		"text2": "Since then, I've grown professionally in companies like <strong>Worldline</strong>, <strong>GMV Innovating Solutions</strong>, and <strong>Hamelyn</strong>, ‚Äî a startup where I'm currently cranking out features like there's no tomorrow. I always have a side project on the go, because I love discovering new technologies, architectures, or any excuse that forces me to open VS Code 'for a bit'.",
		"text3": "I'm drawn to best practices and clean solutions, which naturally leads me to explore design patterns and different architectures ‚Äî though there's always more to learn. I'm also into reading about personal development and other things that don't run in the terminal.",
		"text4": "And outside of code... well, I'm still a full-on nerd: a declared Star Wars fan (the clones, the Jedi, the intergalactic family drama...), and basketball, a sport I played for years. When I need to disconnect, I tend to dive into strategy games like Total War or Crusader Kings 3, where, funnily enough, I still end up managing empires ‚Äî just without the deploys.",
